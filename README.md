Project Description:

-  Developed an AI model using unsupervised learning with datasets from DSLRs, webcams, and Amazon.
-  Implemented advanced techniques, including:
  - Pruning to optimize the model by reducing its size and computational requirements.
  - Domain Adaptation to address distributional differences between datasets and improve performance across domains.
  - Fine-Tuning for further optimizing the model on specific tasks.
-  Applied image augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity and robustness.
-  Visualized results using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including t-SNE for high-dimensional data representation.
-  Evaluated model performance with quantitative metrics such as the F1-score and confusion matrix.
